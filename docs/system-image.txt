System Image
************

Deployment of the application is done by writing the `system image` file onto a
SD card. As every device must have unique identifier and might have different
settings, the ``imagebuild.sh`` script is provided to prepare `system image`
for given device. Usage of this script is described below.

As both ``imagebuild.sh`` and dd commands touch devices or use `mount` command
they need to be run with `root` privileges.

The ``imagebuild.py`` command is inteded to run on your computer, not the
target device.

Once the image is prepared it can be copied using following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    dd if=/path/to/image of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=4M

NOTE: use real ``/path/to/image`` and SD card device name. Image must be
written to SD card raw device, not partition (e.g. no `mmcblk0p1`).

System image partitions take 2GB. Root partition will be grown automatically 
during first boot (this will include two reboots).

Preparing System Image
======================
.. code-block:: bash

    ./imagebuild.sh \
        --run-vjezd \
        --run-tcpgpio \
        --run-mysql \
        --id=vjezd1 \
        --mode=auto \
        --port-button=gpio:22 \
        --port-printer=cups \
        --port-relay=tcpgpio:192.168.1.4,7777,11 \
        --port-scanner=evdev:/dev/input/scanner \
        --db-host=127.0.0.1 \
        --db-dbname=vjezd \
        --db-user=vjezd \
        --db-password=vjezd123 \
        --ip=192.168.1.1 \
        --netmask=255.255.255.0 \
        --gateway=192.168.1.254 \
        --nameserver=8.8.8.8

This will create an empty image file, partition it and using ``kpartx`` mounts
it. Then it will copy necessary files to both partition boot and root; create
various configuration files like ``vjezd.conf`` according to the set options
and write it into image's ``/opt/vjezd/vjezd.conf``.

MySQL Server
------------
If ``--run-mysql`` is set it will also unshadow mysql-server by removing
`/dev/null` link from `/etc/systemd/system/mysql.service` which will cause
fallback to the traditional LSB init script.

Pre-installed MySQL server has `root` password set to `raspberry` and DB
`vjezd` is already created (empty) as well as granted user `vjezd` with
password `vjezd`.

If you ever decide to stop using device as MySQL server, first migrate DB (if
required) to other host. Reconfigure all devices by either manually editing
their ``vjezd.conf`` files or rewriting their SD-cards with newly generated
images (recommended) and then issue (on device) following command as `root`:

.. code-block:: bash

    ln -s /dev/null /etc/systemd/system/mysql.service

and reboot the device by unplugging and plugging it back.

STAR TSP-143 Driver
-------------------
Image contains compiled sources of `STAR TSP-143` thermal printer drivers. If
upgrade is required, download new driver TAR.GZ bundle, unzip it in
``/opt/starcupsdrv`` and:

#. Compile the driver using `make` command
#. DON'T RUN ``bin/setup``
#. Copy files ``rastertostar`` and ``rastertostarlm`` from ``bin/`` to
    ``/usr/lib/cups/filters`` and ensure they're executable
#. Copy gzipped ppd files (all of them) to ``/usr/share/ppd/star``
#. Restart ``CUPS`` by issuing:

.. code-block:: bash

    systemctl restart cups

When adding TSP-143 printer driver please note that it uses same driver as
TSP-100.


Additional Configuration
========================
Once the device boots system image from the SD card. Some additional
configuration might be done.

CUPS
----
`CUPS` in the system image is configured in way the user `pi` can add printers
while the `vjezd` application is configured it uses default printer which is
STAR-TSP143 printer. In order to add new printer and make it default please
use web interface at:

http://device-ip:631

where `device-ip` is IP address of the device, and configure CUPS to fit your
needs. Once asked for administrative password use `pi` as user and `raspberry`
as password.


Image Template Development
==========================
This section describes how the image template is being created and/or updated.
Basically it is image of live device taken and converted to image:

#. Install the latest un-customized (zero settings) image on device
#. Boot the device and do requested modifications
#. Power down the device, mount card on your computer as root
#. Copy both `boot` and `root` partition contents to proper places on your
   filesystem file (NOTE: be sure file owner, group and rights are preserved)
#. Tar newly created partitions to ``boot.tar.bz2`` and ``root.tar.bz2``
#. Test newly created image

NOTE: It is good practice to zero logs in /var/log (don't delete them) and
empty e.g. APT package cache. But it is not required.
